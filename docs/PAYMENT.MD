As a platform, we are not just here to build trust, we are here to also build convenience. Payment currency shouldn't be a drawback to trade in this current age that is why we offer buyers the ability to buy an item in their preferred currency and have the seller withdraw their money in whichever currency they desire as well

##### how will this work?
***

In Nigeria, the preferred currency is the naira, but imagine if you have a domiciliary account and want to have your money as USD, when a buyer wants to checkout, there will be an option to select their payment method from the list of supported options, as soon as the trade is completed, the seller can decide to withdraw the fund into their USD account, then it's left to us to make sure the person gets the money in the specified account.

##### how do we deal with crypto payment?
***
Crypto is volatile, how can you manage that? due to the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency, when a user makes a deposit using crypto, the money will be converted to a stable currency coin like USDT immediately, in case the seller did not ship the item, the buyer can decide to withdraw the fund as crypto, or any other supported method, and if the trade was confirmed, the seller could also withdraw the fund via the supported payment method
