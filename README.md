Due to the lack of trust in the internet, it's harder to order the things you want without the fear of being scammed, and when you summon the courage to place an order, then you end up being scammed. 

Even with this unpleasing situation, I believe there are talented and honest people out there, that don't know how to use the internet to bring their skills to the light. That is why we have built this platform to help bridge that problem. 

Our goal is to help buyers minimize the risk of getting scammed and help those sellers (the people with the skills) to get to the audience there deserved.

## How do we operate
***

We are basically the middle man that helps you minimize the risk between buying and selling online

***
##### there are two ways you can use our service:

***

* [ ] As a registered user: when you see an item that you would like to purchase on our website, once you select the item and checkout, the money will be held in our system and the seller will receive a notification to ship the item (the seller needs to ship the item with his/her money) once the item has been shipped, the order will be in dispute (to avoid automatic cancellation), once the buyer confirms that they have received the item in their custody, the payment will automatically be released to the seller.

***

* [ ] As an anonymous user: you don't have to be registered to our platform to enjoy the benefit that comes with it, if you see an ad or item on the internet that you would like to purchase, message the seller to visit our website to generate a `quickpay` link and send you(the buyer) the generated link to checkout, the money will be held in our system till the two parties have an agreement (when the seller has shipped the item, and when the buyer receive the item)
